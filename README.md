[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kentor/react-flux-testing.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kentor/react-flux-testing)

Sample repository of testing React and Flux (Reflux) with Karma,
Jasmine, and Webpack.

`npm install` then `npm test`.

Note: If you haven't already started a React project, I'd recommend using [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) rather than some form of Flux. Redux reducers is a lot easier to test than Flux stores, and does not need to use the technique shown in this repo.
